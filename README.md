# Project 4: WTWR Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Youâ€™ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

This is the back end portion of the forth project of the Web Development program at Triple Ten. It was created using JavaScript, NodeJs, and Express, based on the design provided through Figma.
